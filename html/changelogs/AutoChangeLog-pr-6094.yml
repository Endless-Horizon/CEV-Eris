changes:
  - tweak: tweaked resist code so the visible message does not display unless you
      are actually attempting to break out
  - balance: you now use the trap to break out of your cuffs faster (basically the
      total time to completely break out evens out)
  - bugfix: fixed infinite handcuff in trap exploit
